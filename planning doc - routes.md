# Project Proposal
"Routes" is a cycling navigation app that provides personalised travel assistance based on :

 > User Health History: Incl High blood pressure, Annemia, Asthma etc

 > Live Monitored Healh Data : Incl Heart rate, Energy level etc

 > Analysis of Current Landscape Conditions : Incl Hill gradients, Weather and Road works etc

"Routes" reccomended route will adapt in real time based on these factors above, to provide the most accomodating and safe journey for the user including suggested pit stops for rest and additional information, for the joruney ahead. This makes cycling in Bristol more personal, accesible and safer giving our users a new confidence and empowering others in different demographics (older, beginner, guardians of children - with the child being the customer etc) to start cycling too, by eliminating any previous terrain fears. As a result the app will promote a healthier and more active community, not just supporting the individual but evolving the culture of cycling in Bristol.

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Cyclists in the hilly region of Bristol may face different unexpected physical strains like steep hills, new road works thus narrowing the path and heightened traffic which can cause difficulty and safety concerns when travelling. Whilst other apps might focus on either user health or landscape insights, they do not combine both elements in one app to give personalised assistance on ones travel. This lack of integration and support can leave cycling as an unenjoyable last resort, as opposed to a prime option for travel and leisure.

### Business benefit - outcomes
> Higher user engagement: Wider range of users (different abilities/demographics etc) encouraged to used routes regularly as a personalised way to get around that is specific to theyâ€™re needs

> Sustainability: Cycling with routes makes greener decisions easier i.e choosing to cycle over  alternative modes of transport that emit greenhouse gases

> Fitness: Users able to become fitter as they choose cycling with routes, which can help with any underlying conditions they may have or other goals 

> Premium features: Offline mapping 


### Options Considered - What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?
> Join Cycling Workout Planner: Recommends fitness activities based on your personal menstral cycle timeline (similar concept of personalising what/how an activity is undertaken based on the users health)

> RidewithGPS: Gives inghts into elevation of different landscapes 

### Expected Risks
> Accurate Data: Making sure all variables are constantly up to date icl traffic, routes, road works etc

> Data protection: GDPR

> User experince: User response to adapted routes 

> Integration of multiple API's 

> Feasibility and Scope management
