# Project Proposal
"Routes" is a cycling navigation app that provides personalised travel assistance based on :

- User Health History: Incl High blood pressure, Annemia, Asthma etc

- Live Monitored Healh Data : Incl Heart rate, Energy level etc

- Bristol Cycle Network : Incl Flatter hills, Pitstops, Parks etc

"Routes" will account for the users health history, current live metrics and how they're feeling at that time, to provide the most accomodating and safe journey for the user including suggested pit stops for rest and additional information, for the jouruney ahead. This makes cycling in Bristol more personal, accessible and safer giving our users a new confidence and empowering others in different demographics (older, beginner, guardians of children - with the child being the customer etc) to start cycling too, by eliminating any previous terrain fears. As a result the app will promote a healthier and more active community, not just supporting the individual but evolving the culture of cycling in Bristol.

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Cyclists in the hilly region of Bristol may face different unexpected physical strains like steep hills, very narrow roads and poorly defined cycle paths that may raise safety concerns when travelling. Whilst other apps might focus on either user health or landscape insights, they do not combine both elements in one app to give personalised assistance on ones travel. This lack of integration and support can leave cycling as an unenjoyable last resort, as opposed to a prime option for travel and leisure.

### Business benefit - Below are High level benefits to "Routes"
- Higher user engagement: Wider range of users (different abilities/demographics etc) encouraged to used routes regularly as a personalised way to get around that is specific to their needs

- Sustainability: Cycling with routes makes greener decisions easier i.e choosing to cycle over  alternative modes of transport that emit greenhouse gases

- Fitness: Users able to become fitter as they choose cycling with routes, which can help with any underlying conditions they may have or other goals 

- Premium features: Offline mapping 


### Options Considered - Below describes two leading products that address similar issues
- "JOIN" is a fitness app helping to improve cycling performance through adaptive training plans, with one of the features being a menstrual cycle tracker from which suggested activity is based on. However "JOIN" focuses more on performance and training.
- Similarly, "RidewithGPS" provides insights into cycling networks and landscape conditions i.e elevation profiles etc, with it's focus more on offering optimal route choices for cyclists with provided terrain challenges.
- Despite the strengths of "JOIN" and "RidewithGPS, they lack the comprehensive personalization, assistance and health sensitive navigation needed. This is an area "Routes" excels in ultimately providing safety, comfort and accesibility in cycling. 

### Expected Risks - Below describes expected/potential risks of the project and functionality of the app
> Data protection: GDPR

> User experience: User response to reccomended routes

> Feasibility and Scope management  

## Project Scope
Purpose:
- This app is designed to provide personalised travel assistance based on the users health history, current live metrics and how they are feeling that day making sure cycling is enjoyable and accessible for all

Audience:
- The target users for this app is bristolians of all abilities, whether advanced cyclists or beginners, whether young or old etc
