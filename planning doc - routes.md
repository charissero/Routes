# Project Proposal
"Routes" is a cycling navigation app that provides personalised travel assistance based on the user's scenery preference/riding prefrence that day whether it be through an urban park, or a quiter riverside etc, giving users the autonomy to choose what routes they take with confidence. All routes are sourced from on the Opendata bristol "Sustrain cycle network". This makes cycling in Bristol more personal while promoting a healthier and greener community.

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Cyclists in the hilly region of Bristol may face different unexpected physical strains like steep hills, very narrow roads and poorly defined cycle paths that may raise safety concerns and uncertainity when travelling. This lack of of focus on cyclists can leave cycling as an unenjoyable last resort, as opposed to a prime option for travel and leisure.

### Business benefit - Below are High level benefits to "Routes"
>Higher user engagement :

- Wider range of users (different abilities/demographics etc) encouraged to used routes regularly as a personalised way to get around that is specific to their request whether that be a specific cycle path or a less advanced cycle route for a beginner to practise etc

>Sustainability :

- Cycling with routes makes greener decisions easier i.e choosing to cycle over alternative modes of transport that emit greenhouse gases

>Fitness:

- Users able to become fitter as they choose cycling with routes, which can help with any underlying conditions they may have or other goals 

>Premium features :

- Offline mapping 

### Options Considered - Below are other options that were considered in order to solve the problem statement :
1. An app that has elevation, traffic and weather insights to accurately advice users on what is ahead and give them advice on how best to approach the journey including planned pitstops.
2. An app with insights into each users health history and current live metrics, of which *Routes* would then suggest the best route for - considering any terrain challenges ahead.
   
- Despite the strengths of **option 1** and **option 2**, the chosen direction for *Routes* in it's simplicity, focuses on providing diverse ways to get around bristol that fit the users preferance that day, whether they would prefer to go through an urban park, or a quiter cannal - the choice is there's.

### Expected Risks - Below describes expected/potential risks of the project and functionality of the app
> Data protection :

- GDPR

> User experience :

- User response to reccomended routes
- If there request cannot be accomodoated with the their destination

> Feasibility and Scope management :

- Keeping activies within the scope 

## Project Scope
>Purpose :
- This app is designed to provide personalised travel assistance based on the users riding preferance that day, with a bank full on diverse routes waiting to be riden.

>Audience :
- The target users for this app is bristolians of all abilities, whether advanced cyclists or beginners, whether young or old etc

>Functionality :
- During onboarding the app will allow users to....
  1. Input their user contact information i.e name, number, emergancy contact(name and number), home address (with a tix box functionality giving permission for their data being stored locally on this device)
  2. Grant access to geolocation (while app is in use)

 - Opendata Bristol 
The app will use a Sustrain Cycle Networks dataset from Open Data Bristol to provide route recommendations based on user-specific constraints.
   
>Interface : 

- The app interface will feature :
1. A fun yet simple layout that is compatible with geolocation and ensures ease of use with adjustements availble like changing font size etc
2. An inital form for collecting onboarding user information
3. Past saved routes that the user has previously ridden (stored locally on that device)
   
>Data handling :

- Collect, process, store and use user data responsibly in alignement with data privacy laws

>Technology :

- The app will be developed using :
1. HTML & JavaScript programming lanaguges for the user interface, route display and interaction
2. CSS for stylesheets/design

>Maintenance : 

1. Maintainer to update the app (with any changes in laws, cycle network data set etc) and manage the app 
2. Maintenance of the app will also include feedback collection from the bristol cyclist community 

> Elements that are *not* in scope:
1. An explore page with AI reccomended routes will not be included in this iteration
2. A log-in and authentication system will not be included in this iteration
3. Integration of weather and landscape elevation API'S will not be included in this iteration
4. Users will not be able to manually design and save their own routes in this iteration
5. Turn-by-turn navigation will not be included in this iteration
