# Project Proposal
"Routes" is a cycling navigation app that provides personalised travel assistance based on how the user is feeling/what they're riding prefrence is that day whether it be through an urban park, or a quiter riverside etc. All routes are sourced from on the Opendata bristol "Sustrain cycle network". This makes cycling in Bristol more personal while promoting a healthier and greener community.

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Cyclists in the hilly region of Bristol may face different unexpected physical strains like steep hills, very narrow roads and poorly defined cycle paths that may raise safety concerns when travelling. This lack of of focus on cyclists can leave cycling as an unenjoyable last resort, as opposed to a prime option for travel and leisure.

### Business benefit - Below are High level benefits to "Routes"
>Higher user engagement :

- Wider range of users (different abilities/demographics etc) encouraged to used routes regularly as a personalised way to get around that is specific to their needs

>Sustainability :

- Cycling with routes makes greener decisions easier i.e choosing to cycle over  alternative modes of transport that emit greenhouse gases

>Fitness:

- Users able to become fitter as they choose cycling with routes, which can help with any underlying conditions they may have or other goals 

>Premium features :

- Offline mapping 

### Options Considered - Below are other options that were considered in order to solve the problem statement :
1. An app that has elevation, traffic and weather insights to accurately advice users on what is ahead and give them advice on how best to approach the journey including planned pitstops.
2. An app with insights into each users health history and current live metrics, of which *Routes* would then suggest the best route for - considering any terrain challenges ahead.
Despite the strengths of **option 1** and **option 2**, the chosen direction for *Routes* in its simplicity, focuses on providing diverse way to get around bristol that fit the users preferance that day, whether they would prefer to go through an urban park, or a qutier cannal - the choice is there's.

### Expected Risks - Below describes expected/potential risks of the project and functionality of the app
> Data protection :

- GDPR

> User experience :

- User response to reccomended routes

> Feasibility and Scope management :

- Keeping activies within the scope and getting completing everything within scope
