# Project Proposal
"Routes" is a cycling navigation app that provides personalised travel assistance based on :

- User Health History: Incl High blood pressure, Annemia, Asthma etc

- (Optional) Live Monitored Healh Data : Incl Heart rate, Energy level etc

- Bristol Cycle Network : Incl Flatter hills, Pitstops, Parks etc

"Routes" will account for the users health history, (optional) current live metrics and how they're feeling at that time, to provide the most accomodating and safe journey for the user including suggested pit stops for rest and additional information, for the jouruney ahead. This makes cycling in Bristol more personal, accessible and safer giving our users a new confidence and empowering others in different demographics (older, beginner, guardians of children - with the child being the customer etc) to start cycling too, by eliminating any previous terrain fears. As a result the app will promote a healthier and more active community, not just supporting the individual but evolving the culture of cycling in Bristol.

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Cyclists in the hilly region of Bristol may face different unexpected physical strains like steep hills, very narrow roads and poorly defined cycle paths that may raise safety concerns when travelling. Whilst other apps might focus on either user health or landscape insights, they do not combine both elements in one app to give personalised assistance on ones travel. This lack of integration and support can leave cycling as an unenjoyable last resort, as opposed to a prime option for travel and leisure.

### Business benefit - Below are High level benefits to "Routes"
- Higher user engagement: Wider range of users (different abilities/demographics etc) encouraged to used routes regularly as a personalised way to get around that is specific to their needs

- Sustainability: Cycling with routes makes greener decisions easier i.e choosing to cycle over  alternative modes of transport that emit greenhouse gases

- Fitness: Users able to become fitter as they choose cycling with routes, which can help with any underlying conditions they may have or other goals 

- Premium features: Offline mapping 

### Options Considered - Below describes two leading products that address similar issues
- "JOIN" is a fitness app helping to improve cycling performance through adaptive training plans, with one of the features being a menstrual cycle tracker from which suggested activity is based on. However "JOIN" focuses more on performance and training.
- Similarly, "RidewithGPS" provides insights into cycling networks and landscape conditions i.e elevation profiles etc, with it's focus more on offering optimal route choices for cyclists with provided terrain challenges.
- Despite the strengths of "JOIN" and "RidewithGPS, they lack the comprehensive personalization, assistance and health sensitive navigation needed. This is an area "Routes" excels in ultimately providing safety, comfort and accesibility in cycling. 

### Expected Risks - Below describes expected/potential risks of the project and functionality of the app
- Data protection: GDPR

- User experience: User response to reccomended routes

- Feasibility and Scope management  

## Project Scope
>Purpose:
- This app is designed to provide personalised travel assistance based on the users health history, current live metrics and how they are feeling that day making sure cycling is enjoyable and accessible for all

>Audience:
- The target users for this app is bristolians of all abilities, whether advanced cyclists or beginners, whether young or old etc

2. Health history data (diabetes, asthma, annemia etc)
3. Personal information concerning age, ethnicity, gender, weight etc
5. Cycling landscape preferences like parks, no hills etc
6. Optional syncing with wearable technology to monitor live metrics e.g stammina levels
 - This information will curate their User profile - which can be changed at any point
 - Opendata Bristol : The app will use a Bristol Cycle Networks dataset from Open Data Bristol to provide route recommendations based on user-specific constraints (e.g. how they're feeling, health history and terrain preferences).

>Interface: 

The app interface will feature :
1. A fun yet simple layout that is compatible with geolocation and ensures ease of use with adjustements availble like changing font size etc
2. An inital form for collecting onboarding information
3. A feedback prompt to collect the user's condition before each journey i.e how they're feeling i.e energised, tired, wants fresh air etc
4. An interactive map for displaying suggested cycling route incl interactive icons showing what is ahead on the route like hills, parks etc 

>Data handling :

Collect, process, store and use user data responsibly in alignement with data privacy laws

>Technology :

The app will be developed using :
1. HTML & JavaScript for UI, route display and interaction
2. CSS for data processing and user profiles

>Maintenance : 

1. Maintainer to update the app (with any changes in laws, API etc) and manage the app
