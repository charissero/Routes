# Project Proposal
"Routes" is a cycling navigation app that provides personalised travel assistance based on :

 > User Health History: Incl High blood pressure, Annemia, Asthma etc 
 > Live Monitored Healh Data : Incl Heart rate, Energy level etc
 > Analysis of Current Landscape Conditions : Incl Hill gradients, Weather and Road works etc

"Routes" reccomended route will adapt in real time based on these factors above, to provide the most accomodating and safe journey for the user including suggested pit stops for rest and additional information, for the joruney ahead. This makes cycling in Bristol more personal, accesible and safer giving our users a new confidence and empowering others in different demographics (older, beginner, guardians of children - with the child being the customer etc) to start cycling too, by eliminating any previous terrain fears. As a result the app will promote a healthier and more active community, not just supporting the individual but evolving the culture of cycling in Bristol.

 Scenario; //Different from use case - just helping with visualisation 
 User 1 has a history of Anemia and can get tired on longer journeys. With it set to rain in 10 minutes, traffic is predicted to increase by 15%, prolonging user 1's journey to 1 hour instead of 30 minutes, with two steep hills along the way. Routes adapts User 1's journey : On this route User 1 will have a pitstop where they can rest inside a cafe before continuing , and there will only be one hill ahead instead of two. This route will take 35 minutes excluding the rest time. There will also be information about the elevation of that hill, how far the pitstop is from where they are currently, hydration and when the rain will stop etc. 

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Cyclists in the hilly region of Bristol may face different unexpected physical strains like steep hills, new road conditions thus narrowing the path and heightened traffic which can cause difficulty and safety concerns when travelling. Though some apps focus on cycling with insights on the landscape and other apps focused on the health of the user, there is a lack of integration between the two elements that provide real-time, adaptive guidance  considering both personal health and current travel conditions, informing users of how best to approach the travel. This lack of integration can leave cycling as an unenjoyable last resort, as opposed to a prime option for travel and leisure.

### Business benefit - outcomes
> Higher user engagement: More users of different abilities/demographics encouraged to used routes regularly as a personalised way to get around that is specific to theyâ€™re needs.

> Sustainability: Cycling with routes makes greener decisions easier i.e choosing to cycle over  alternative modes of transport that emit greenhouse gases

> Fitness: Users able to become fitter as they choose cycling with routes, which can help with any underlying conditions they may have or other goals 

> Revenue: Competitive edge leading to more revenue


### Options Considered - What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?
> Join Cycling Workout Planner: Recommends fitness activities based on your personal menstral cycle timeline (similar concept of personalising what/how an activity is undertaken based on the users health).
> RidewithGPS: gives inghts into elevation of different landscapes 

### Expected Risks
- Keeping data on different routes, conditions, roadworks etc updated 
- GDPR
- Accuracry of adapted route and user response to the new route
- Using multiple API's with potentially different data formats
