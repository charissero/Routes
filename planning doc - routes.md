# Project Proposal
"Routes" is a cycling navigation app that provides personalised travel assistance based on :

 > User Health History: Incl High blood pressure, Annemia, Asthma etc

 > Live Monitored Healh Data : Incl Heart rate, Energy level etc

 > Analysis of Current Landscape Conditions : Incl Hill gradients, Weather and Road works etc

"Routes" recommended route will adapt in real time based on these factors above, to provide the most accomodating and safe journey for the user including suggested pit stops for rest and additional information, for the jouruney ahead. This makes cycling in Bristol more personal, accessible and safer giving our users a new confidence and empowering others in different demographics (older, beginner, guardians of children - with the child being the customer etc) to start cycling too, by eliminating any previous terrain fears. As a result the app will promote a healthier and more active community, not just supporting the individual but evolving the culture of cycling in Bristol.

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Cyclists in the hilly region of Bristol may face different unexpected physical strains like steep hills, new road works thus narrowing the path and heightened traffic which can cause difficulty and safety concerns when travelling. Whilst other apps might focus on either user health or landscape insights, they do not combine both elements in one app to give personalised assistance on ones travel. This lack of integration and support can leave cycling as an unenjoyable last resort, as opposed to a prime option for travel and leisure.

### Business benefit - outcomes
> Higher user engagement: Wider range of users (different abilities/demographics etc) encouraged to used routes regularly as a personalised way to get around that is specific to their needs

> Sustainability: Cycling with routes makes greener decisions easier i.e choosing to cycle over  alternative modes of transport that emit greenhouse gases

> Fitness: Users able to become fitter as they choose cycling with routes, which can help with any underlying conditions they may have or other goals 

> Premium features: Offline mapping 


### Options Considered - What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?
> "JOIN" is a fitness app helping to improve cycling performance through adaptive training plans, with one of the features being a menstrual cycle tracker from which suggested activity is based on. However "JOIN" focuses more on performance and training. Similarly, "RidewithGPS" provides insights into cycling networks and landscape conditions i.e elevation profiles etc, with it's focus more on offering optimal route choices for cyclists with provided terrain challenges. Despite the strengths of "JOIN" and "RidewithGPS, they lack the comprehensive personalization, assistance and health sensitive navigation needed. This is an area "Routes" excels in ultimately providing safety, comfort and accesibility in cycling. 

### Expected Risks
> Accurate Data: Making sure all variables are constantly up to date incl traffic, routes, road works etc

> Data protection: GDPR

> User experience: User response to adapted routes 

> Integration of multiple API's 

> Feasibility and Scope management  

## Project Scope

> Front end : HTML & JavaScript for UI, Route display and real time update intergration from different sources i.e weather data etc

> Backend : C# for user profles, route calculations, processing data and communication with various API's


> API's involved :
 Health API - Showing user's health history

 Weather API - Showing weather past, present and future weather conditions 
 
 Traffic API - Showing past, present and future traffic insights
 
 Mapping and Elevation API - Key element in route reccomendations and showing landscape insights


 > Mobile style :
 UI Design - Ensure inclusivity by making app very easy to navigate

 Compatibility - App compatible with mobiles


 > Wearable technology : To monitor live health e.g stammina levels


 > User data : Collect, proccess and store user information like number, email, route preferances and contacts including SOS contacts


 > Maintence : Maintainer to update the app (with any changes in laws, API etc) and manage the app
