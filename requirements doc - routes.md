    Summarise these using the use-case template below..

| UC1 | UC1: Recieve Cycle path in an urban area | Author: Charisse Oppon |

| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |

| **Description** | As an international student, I want a personalised route today where I can cycle in an urban area to sight-see as I go home |

| **Actors** | International student (beginner level cyclist) |

| **Steps** | 1. User inputs request to go through an urban area on the way home for 
                 sightseeing purposes
              2. System requests for access to geolocation
              3. If access granted, system will retrieve nearest route details from the database 
                 that matches the criteria
              4. System will format and display route details i.e route name, characteristics and 
                 status - Avon cycle way, Cycle path in ubran area, traffic free route 
              5. Prompt User to accept or decline route

                   2. Users geolocation is turned off
                   4. Route doesn't have a route name 
                   5. User declines route |
                   
| **Non-functional** | 1. The system should display "This route cannot be found, what about x routes" and suggest three similar routes that can be found in the database and collect feedback from user. 2. The system should prompt the User to re-enable geolocation and guide them to the device’s settings. 4. System should display "Unamed route", the characteristic and the status. 5. The system should generate a text prompt for feedback on the declined route (to find out why the user doesn't like the route), alter the route based on this, display new route and collect feedback for new route. |
